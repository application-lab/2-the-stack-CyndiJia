            <p>DIDI is an mobile application designed for users to call for taxis online without stepping out of their room. 
                DIDI can detect the location of the user, and the user can enter the destination can choose different types of
                cars to call. It is very popular because it saves a lot of time for the user also enabling users to stay in a 
                comfortable environment when requesting for a car.

                However sometimes the location detection can be very inaccurate, but the location detection is somehow the only
                tool for the driver to get to the user. The structure of a city is so complicated that we cannot guarantee the 
                location detection to be 100% accurate at any time. If the user does not manually set the location to where he/she 
                actually is, it might end up with the situation that the user and the driver are at totally different places.
